# selenium_course_final_project
This is my final project on the Stepic's Selenium+Python course.

Here are a UI-tests for the online store http://selenium1py.pythonanywhere.com/.

Link to the course: https://stepik.org/course/575

Usage example: `pytest -v --tb=line --language=en --browser=chrome -m need_review`

If `--language` isn't specified, English is used by default.

If `--browser` isn't specified, Chrome or Chromium is used by default.
